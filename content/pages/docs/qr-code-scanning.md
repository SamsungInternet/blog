## Notes

* For QR codes that contain a URL, the URL will open up directly in the browser.
* For QR codes containing text, the text will be displayed on a ‘Scan result’ page. You can double-tap or press-and-hold to copy and paste it somewhere.
* The scanner also works with barcodes. It will automatically search for the barcode number in your default search engine.
