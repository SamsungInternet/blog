### Step 1

To add a web app to your homescreen just open up Samsung Internet Browser and go to your favourite website.
If there is a plus icon in the address bar then it’s a progressive web app and you can add it to your homescreen.

### Step 2

Tap on that plus and you’ll be given two options, Bookmarks and Homescreen. If you tap on Homescreen a message will pop up saying that a shortcut to the app has been added to your homescreen.

If you don’t get the plus icon you can still go to the menu, the 3 dots on the right of the address bar, and tap ‘Add to homescreen’ from there, this will create a bookmark to the site.

### Step 3


If you take a look at the last page of your home screen then you should see a new icon.

Apps added like this can have all the features of similar apps from the Play Store, they can even send you notifications.
