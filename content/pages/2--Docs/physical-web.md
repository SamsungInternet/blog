The Physical Web is an open source project initiated by Google and supported by Samsung.
Like regular Bluetooth beacons, Physical Web beacons can broadcast information that can
be read by devices such as your smartphone, when you are within range.

Physical Web beacons broadcast short URLs, using the 
[Eddystone-URL](https://github.com/google/eddystone/tree/master/eddystone-url) format.
These can be detected by web browsers or other applications and used to display details
about the web page.

Physical Web allows you to "walk up and use anything". It reduces the friction for accessing
web content, making relevant content just a tap away. Some examples could include:

* A bus stop which broadcasts a link to the timetable
* A museum which broadcasts online information about the current exhibits
* A shop which broadcasts a special offer

Samsung Internet's Physical Web service is called [CloseBy](/docs/closeby). It can be
enabled in the settings menu, from version 5.4.
