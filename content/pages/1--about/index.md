[Samsung Internet for Android](http://developer.samsung.com/internet#android-overview) is the web browser that is pre-installed on Samsung Galaxy phones and tablets.
It is based on the open source [Chromium project](https://www.chromium.org/), to which Samsung are a major contributor.
The browser is made available via the Galaxy Apps Store, the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sec.android.app.sbrowser) and carrier updates.
In March 2017, [we launched a public beta version](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/samsung-internet-beta-now-available-without-sign-up-e0d5d4010838)
and the browser was subsequently [released for all Android 5+ phones](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/samsung-internet-v6-2-now-stable-ab7f95ed8b4b).

Samsung Internet has [hundreds of millions of active users](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/10/whats-the-deal-with-the-samsung-internet-browser/#market-shares) 
who tend to rate it highly (at the time of writing, it has a 4.4 out of 5 star rating [on the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sec.android.app.sbrowser)).
