# Introducing Quick Suggest, your personal shopping assistant from Samsung Internet!



As holiday shopping season is approaching fast, we are very excited to announce **Quick Suggest, **a shopping assistant built right into Samsung Internet browser.

Quick suggest is a smart assistant for your browser and your own personal shopper. It gets important info right when you need it while you browse. It suggests related articles, awesome offers, expert reviews to take your shopping to the next level. When you are searching for a product or shopping online on a retailer website, with one tap, Quick Suggest brings the best deals to you, to save you time and money, and to help you make smarter decisions.

Quick Suggest brings you the same awesome cashback offers you can find on [**Samsung Pay](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00079869/)**, right to your browser, with just a tap. You’ll earn money for everything you buy from their online store or app during the promotional period. Once you’ve received the Cash Back, you can redeem it and use it to make purchases through Samsung Pay! It’s that simple!
