# Introducing Llama Vision, a website that detects llamas through your camera

a.k.a. How I got started using Tensorflow.js

![[https://llama.vision](https://llama.vision) (video shown in the background by [Karen Ihrig](https://vimeo.com/46661900))](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7116/1*eMKq2EB1CZzA4SCMk6dZVw.jpeg)*[https://llama.vision](https://llama.vision) (video shown in the background by [Karen Ihrig](https://vimeo.com/46661900))*

A few months ago, I first tried out [Tensorflow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/), the machine learning library for JavaScript. I took a pre-trained model I found called [MobileNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/mobilenet) and copied some of the [example code](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/mobilenet/README.md#via-script-tag). One of the lines said *‚Äúreplace this with your image‚Äù*, but I thought I‚Äôd try it out on a video instead. I grabbed a [Creative Commons video of some llamas](https://vimeo.com/46661900) and‚Ä¶ I was astonished!

It gave a probability of over 0.99999 that the video contained a llama. I figured that, to get that level of certainty, perhaps I had just happened to pick one of the exact videos used to train the model. I noticed that the model file was only 31KB. I opened it up and found that it contained a collection that looked like this:

![Some of the text from the [MobileNet JavaScript file](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow-models/mobilenet@0.1.1). One of the collection‚Äôs entries is ‚Äúllama‚Äù.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/1*fGT2VNDbg0klUoU5bN9pBQ.png)*Some of the text from the [MobileNet JavaScript file](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow-models/mobilenet@0.1.1). One of the collection‚Äôs entries is ‚Äúllama‚Äù.*

Even if I hadn‚Äôt been lucky enough to use one of the exact same training videos, I was at least fortunate enough to be trying to detect one of the 1000 objects that this model included (entry 355 from 0 to 999).

Next I wondered if I could switch a pre-recorded video for live camera input, via [getUserMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia). At first, it didn‚Äôt work, giving me the error: *‚ÄúRequested texture size [0x0] is invalid‚Äù*. I wondered at first if it was an intentional restriction. Thankfully, [the solution](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/322) was simply to set the ‚Äòwidth‚Äô and ‚Äòheight‚Äô attributes on the video element. I pointed the camera at a picture of a llama on my screen (as I didn‚Äôt have a real llama to hand üòû)‚Ä¶ *And it worked!*

Now I‚Äôve added a simple user interface and hosted it up at [https://llama.vision](https://llama.vision), so you can try it too:

The source code is [here on Github](https://github.com/poshaughnessy/llama-vision). The key piece of code is small and straightforward ‚Äî Tensorflow and MobileNet do all the hard work for us:

One thing to note is that in Android browsers I‚Äôve tried other than Chrome, Tensorflow.js is giving a warning *‚ÄúExtension WEBGL_lose_context not supported on this browser‚Äù* and the model takes a long time to load and calculate (I guess because it fails to use WebGL for better performance). Hopefully I‚Äôll come across a solution for this soon.

And one day I hope to make it to a llama farm ‚Äî so I can test it out in real life!

*If you‚Äôre based near London and interested in machine learning with JavaScript, our friend [Asim Hussain](undefined) runs a regular [AI JavaScript London meetup](https://www.meetup.com/AI-JavaScript-London/). Maybe I‚Äôll see you there!*
