WebVR has had a tremendous year! [Firefox 55 stable has landed support](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/firefox-55-supports-webvr/), [Edge now implements the spec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webvr/webvr-with-edge), [Opera has a built in 360/VR player](https://twitter.com/opera/status/910853533561425920), and a wide selection of controllers are accesible to use in conjunction with WebVR. If you are as excited as we are, you’ll be delighted to hear that we are announcing the [**first W3C Workshop on WebVR Authoring**](https://w3c.github.io/webvr-content-workshop/)! We are bringing browser vendors, framework developers and content creators together for the time to discuss opportunities and challenges for WebVR!
