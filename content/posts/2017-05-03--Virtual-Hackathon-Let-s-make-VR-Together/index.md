Please submit a link to your demo when you are ready. You can still update your site until the deadline.

### “I’ve never built VR before”

There are useful tools and libraries for working with VR in the web, here are two which are very accessible for beginners:

*   [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) build a Virtual Reality scene using HTML
*   [Play Canvas](https://playcanvas.com/) an online editor which supports VR!

### “Where do I put my demo?”

There are many places online for showing off demos, two great ones are:

*   Glitch.com — Allows you to remix other projects to get started quickly. [Try Remixing the A-Frame Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/aframe?path=index.html:1:0)

Press the ‘Remix this’ button to edit it in your Web Browser.

*   If you are comfortable with Git, [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a great way to host and show off your demos.

### “I don’t have a VR Headset”

You don’t need an expensive VR Headset to build VR, many WebVR experiences will work with an Android or iOS smart phone and a Google Cardboard.

The BBC has kindly donated some Google Cardboards we can post to you (within the UK) to help you test your scene in Virtual Reality. To request one contact Ada at:

*   email: ada.edwards@samsung.com
*   twitter: @lady\_ada\_king

### Restrictions

Must work in a web browser using WebVR.

It’ll be great if it works in the Google Cardboard or for Mobile Headsets like the Google Daydream or Samsung GearVR. But we do have a HTC Vive we can test on too.

### Submitting

Entries should be hosted somewhere and can be submitted via email:

To: ada.edwards@samsung.com  
Subject: “vrtogether, \[Your Name\]”

With a link to your demo, a name and a short description.

The demos will be collated into a gallery so people can view them.
