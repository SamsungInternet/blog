### Opening Up the Beta

We’re often asked by developers if we can allow access to a Beta version of the Samsung Internet browser. This year Samsung Internet has been evolving quickly. For example, with the launch of 4.0 earlier this year we’ve moved away from version updates linked to firmware releases to an evergreen approach distributed through app stores. It’s fairly important for developers to be able to test web apps against new features before they roll out to the released versions of major browsers.

Now we’re excited to announce we’re going to be opening up a Beta channel of Samsung Internet so that developers can start getting early access to our 5.0 version to test their web apps before it launches. For the time being, this will be on a by-request basis but we’re going to be pretty liberal about approving requests. For now, we’d also like to know who is accessing the Beta so we can keep in touch with you and ensure we’re also getting product feedback. If you would like to have access to the Beta version of Samsung Internet, please [fill out the access request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjqSapawwHwnImPXT_rtlY-Dp2EFcmyko1elVAMIiWGdPdTA/viewform) and tell us a little about yourself and what you’re working on. We’ll respond shortly with instructions on how to get set up. Happy testing!
