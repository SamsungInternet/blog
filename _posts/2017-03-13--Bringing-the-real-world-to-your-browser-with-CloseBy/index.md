### Bringing the real world to your browser with¬†CloseBy

Imagine you‚Äôre hurrying towards your bus stop in the pouring rain (not an unlikely scenario here in London üòâ). You dive under the shelter, but there‚Äôs no digital display board. How long will you have to sit and shiver there before your bus arrives?

On previous occasions, you‚Äôd resorted to texting a special number displayed on a poster there‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand paying for the privilege! But this time, there‚Äôs no need. A silent notification is right there on your phone, with a direct link to view the bus times for your specific location. A single tap and‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähey that‚Äôs pretty good‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääonly 2 minutes to wait for the bus!

> ‚ÄúWalk up and use anything‚Äù

This is a [real life example](http://marketingland.com/london-buses-test-first-consumer-experience-physical-web-170529) of [Physical Web](https://google.github.io/physical-web/), an open source project initiated by Google. It boils down to a simple concept: Bluetooth beacons are placed at physical locations and they broadcast relevant URLs. When you‚Äôre in the vicinity, your phone detects this and displays details about the webpage, allowing you to access it directly if you wish.

There are [many possible uses](https://blog.beaconstac.com/2016/03/8-ways-eddystone-and-the-physical-web-can-make-your-daily-life-easier/). Imagine you‚Äôre arriving at a conference and you need to check the schedule to decide which talk to attend first. No need to dig out the conference URL‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs being broadcast right there at the front door. Or imagine you want to borrow a car from your car sharing scheme. No need to remember your membership card; once you walk up to the car, a notification is right there on your phone prompting you to access it.

In essence, it‚Äôs all about removing friction. _‚ÄúEverything should be just a tap away‚Äù_.

#### CloseBy

Now we are bringing the Physical Web to Samsung‚Äôs web browser, [Samsung Internet](http://developer.samsung.com/internet). There is no need for a separate app download; it‚Äôs an extension provided directly with the browser, called _CloseBy_.

Diego and I have been known to carry around our own beacons, to help you spot us (or run away from us) at conferences!

We introduced an early preview of CloseBy with our first [Samsung Internet v5 beta](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/beta-d0f988fb77fb). Now it‚Äôs available for a much wider audience with our [newly opened up beta channel](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/samsung-internet-beta-now-available-without-sign-up-e0d5d4010838).

To enable/disable and see the list of beacons around you, you can visit CloseBy via the Extensions menu:

But really, you shouldn‚Äôt need to do anything manually. CloseBy is designed to identify beacons automatically and display the link ready for if/when you want it:

Hooray, a notification like this means I must be nearby! Maybe you can catch me with a pokeball?

If you would like to try it out with your own beacon, there are many manufacturers out there and it should be easy to search for sites that sell them. You can also use an app like [Beacon Toy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.uriio&hl=en_GB) on Android in order to turn a phone into a beacon!

#### Peace and¬†privacy

It‚Äôs important to note that Physical Web is designed to be unobtrusive:

Upon receiving a URL from the Physical Web object, your phone sends that up to our servers in order to find the title of the page and determine whether to show it. However, no personal information is included and our servers do not collect any information about users at all. As my colleagues have [shared previously](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/many-browsers-one-web-21730352afbc#c006), privacy is a brand promise for Samsung Internet and we take it very seriously.

I‚Äôm excited about how the Physical Web can help to bridge the real world and the digital world. As the ecosystem grows, imagine how useful it could be for learning about‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand interacting with‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe world around us!
