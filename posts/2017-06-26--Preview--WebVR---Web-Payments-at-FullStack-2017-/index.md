### Preview: WebVR & Web Payments at FullStack 2017!

[FullStack](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/8264-fullstack-2017-the-conference-on-javascript-node-and-internet-of-things), the JavaScript, Node and IoT conference, is returning to London next monthâ€Šâ€”â€Šand [Ada](https://medium.com/u/c2890cdd7a64) and I will be there!

Ada is speaking on the first day right after [Douglas Crockford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford) (so no pressure Ada! ðŸ˜‰). Ada will be talking about _Virtual Reality and the future of the Webâ€Šâ€”â€Š_sharing the awesome potential of [WebVR](https://webvr.rocks/) and showing some of the demos that blew minds at the recent [CSS Day](https://cssday.nl/2017)!

If you feel that WebVR is too new to start exploring already, you might be interested to know that the API has been [in development since 2014](https://web.archive.org/web/20140628202048/http://blog.bitops.com/blog/2014/06/26/first-steps-for-vr-on-the-web/) and companies like [Pearson](https://peteroshaughnessy.com/posts/augmented-reality-virtual-reality-education/), [Renault](http://kadjar-vr.littleworkshop.fr/), [Iberia](http://virtualflight.iberia.com/), [TUI Group](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/prototyping-a-vr-web-app-with-the-worlds-leading-tourism-company-aa7965c5a563) [and more](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dip3jhzwxLb4m4MyyU2XYC-IFOxDraa2tiegqnYpA88/edit?usp=sharing) have all been starting to work with it. _Side note:_ Our colleague [uve](https://medium.com/u/387f13d790e3) will be speaking more about how companies are using WebVR today, at [WebXR Paris on July 5th](https://www.meetup.com/WebXR-Paris/events/240575459/)!

On Day 2 of FullStack, Iâ€™ll be giving a 15-minute tour of _Web Payments._ Did you know  [around 70% of online checkouts are abandoned](https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate)â€Šâ€”â€Šwith [a study](https://econsultancy.com/blog/64343-checkout-abandonment-mobile-ux-examples-to-help-boost-conversions/) showing the abandonment rate is nearly 25% higher on mobile than desktop? Over a quarter of [survey respondents](https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate#why-users-abandon) said the reason was the checkout process was too long / complicated. So if browsers can provide APIs for easy online checkouts, that can be a big win for our customers and us developers alike.

[Samsung Internet](https://samsunginter.net/)â€Šâ€”â€Š[along with Chrome and Edge](http://caniuse.com/#search=payment%20request)â€Šâ€”â€Šsupports the [Payment Request API](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/how-to-take-payments-on-the-web-with-the-payment-request-api-a523f6fc7c1f), a browser-provided UI that you can use to collect your usersâ€™ payment and shipping details. Iâ€™ll share how to use it in my lightning talk and also introduce the new [Payment Handler API](https://www.w3.org/blog/wpwg/2017/05/18/payment-handler-api-first-public-working-draft-published/).

Weâ€™re excited to meet old friends and new friends at FullStack. If you can make it along, we look forward to seeing you there! (And if you canâ€™t, you can [follow along on social media](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23fullstackcon&src=typd)!)
