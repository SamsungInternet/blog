# Happy Hacktoberfest from Samsung Internet🎃 👻 💻

Can you believe that it is nearly October already?! I know we’d all love time to slow down but I’m pretty hyped for October & here’s why…

### Hacktoberfest!

*What is Hacktoberfest? *It is a month-long celebration of open source software. People are encouraged to submit **five pull requests **to GitHub-hosted repositories **between the 1st and 31st of October**. [You can find out more about Hacktoberfest here.](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) It’s now in it’s fifth year — which is amazing!

*Ok, why would I want to take part?* Well, you get a snazzy t-shirt if you complete all five pull requests in the Hacktoberfest period. **BUT it is about way more than a t-shirt!**

Hacktoberfest is a time when the open source community comes together to collaborate. In this time you’ll see lots of nice things happening like people adding the “hacktoberfest” and “good first PR” labels to anything that would be a good first pull request for beginners. On top of this, there are numerous events where people come together and mentor folks who are making their first ever pull request. Hacktoberfest is about community and it’s a great initiative to get involved in!

There is a huge amount of activity that happens around this time of year just look at the stats for 2017:

### And you can get involved too…

In the true spirit of community, we here at Samsung Internet thought it would be a nice to host an event for this years Hacktoberfest. Why not join us?

We will be taking over the Microsoft Reactor Space in London from 6pm on Friday 5th October — with support from our lovely friends at Microsoft — and hosting an entire evening of open sourced flavoured things.

The event is open to ANYONE that is interested in learning about and/or contributing to open source, whether you are a senior developer or an absolute beginner.

**Here’s a quick look at the agenda:**

* Welcome

* Intro to Hacktoberfest: the celebration, prizes, and instructions

* Intro to Git and GitHub (for beginners — optional)

* Mentored Hack time

We hope to create an open and inclusive space to collaborate on pull requests and learn about open source together.

**So what are you waiting for?**

Want to join in with Hacktoberfest but can’t attend the event — no problem!

The best part about open source projects is that you can take part wherever you are —[ check out Lee Reilly’s post on the GitHub blog for more info.](https://blog.github.com/2018-09-24-hacktoberfest-is-back-and-celebrating-its-fifth-year/)
