#### Mobile World Progress Barcelona 2017

If you follow mobile tech, you know that Barcelona is one of those places you have to be near the end of February. And I’m not referring to the fact that temperatures are starting to get _so much_ nicer or that _Castellers_ season training has resumed, but to the fact that Mobile World Congress is right around the corner.

Well, turns out temperature and mobiles will not be the only things getting attention. **We’re announcing a gathering of developers to preview what’s coming to web technology: Welcome to Mobile World Progress 2017**.

Led by @torgo, join @ladybenko, @dontcallmedom, @salvadelapuente and myself (@diekus) in an discussion of web goodies headed to browsers near you.

### Intro to HTML5 game development

The Web is in better shape that never before to be a gaming platform.  
HTML5 technologies allow us to create games, 3D and 2D, with a rich audio capabilities, support for gamepads, touch events, etc. If you are a web developer, but have not yet created a game, this talk is for you! We will see what the Web has to offer us for game development, which tools and libraries we have at our disposable, and some basic game development concepts to get you started with the tools of your choice.

### The Right Choice: When the Web is the right answer and why?

Going native or building for Web is a perennial hot topic in the mobile development space, but treating these alternatives as irreconcilable is naive. Nowadays, each option offers distinct opportunities and advantages. 2016 was the year we kick a bunch of technologies off: Service Workers, Web Manifest, Push and Sync to name a few, but that was not the end. Payments and Credential Management are taking off, and new insights from 2016 force us to reconsider the Web as a competitive platform.

### Hypertextual Reality: VR on the Web

Virtual Reality has seen the launch of 5 platforms from different vendors over the past year and a half. Developer portal registrations, app store accounts and increasingly complicated workflows can hurt VR, and having a way of developing immersive experiences on an open technology stack is highly beneficial. One option is implementing VR on the web, coupling the open approach of the web technologies with immersive experiences of virtual reality.
