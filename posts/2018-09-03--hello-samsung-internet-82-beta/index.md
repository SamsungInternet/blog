Our new Beta version of [Samsung Internet](https://samsunginter.net/about) is now being rolled out [on the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sec.android.app.sbrowser.beta) and will be available to everyone (Android 5+) within the next few days. The current stable version of this major update, v8.0, has just started shipping now with the shiny new [Galaxy Note 9](https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-note9/buy/). The Beta is an opportunity to check the same major version ‚Äî and the minor version that will soon be released for all supported phones.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new this time:

### Faster file downloads

We have introduced a new optimised download system which can offer a significant speed improvement. Larger files** **now download in chunks using multiple, parallel connections. In our tests (depending on network availability and system configuration) we have observed this achieving a 15‚Äì40% speed improvement!

### Do Not Track

We have improved our options for user privacy by adding a* Do Not Track*** **option in the settings. This adds the [Do Not Track header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) to requests, which asks websites not to track your browsing habits.

### Quick Access transfer

Quick Access is one of the default homepages for Samsung Internet, which lets you visit your favourite sites with a single tap. You can now backup and restore your Quick Access items across devices with v8.2+, using [Smart Switch](https://www.samsung.com/us/smart-switch/).

### Chromium engine upgrade

The core engine has upgraded from Chromium M59 in v7.x to Chromium M63 for v8.x. This introduces some really powerful features for web developers, including:

* [JavaScript Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) (including dynamic imports)

* CSS properties such as [font-display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-display) and [overscroll-behaviour](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overscroll-behavior)

* [navigator.connection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/connection)

If you have an Android 5+ device, we hope you will give [the new Beta](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sec.android.app.sbrowser.beta) a try and let us know what you think!

*Thank you to [Ada Rose](undefined) for helping to prepare this post. Updated 4th September to clarify details about Quick Access transfer.*
