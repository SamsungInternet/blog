There is really no better way to set the theme of a conference and inspire attendees than with a good opening keynote. At the [Create conference](https://samsungcreate.com), we were fortunate to have the following keynote speakers.

Léonie’s talk, *The Art of Noise (keep talking), *covers how voice interaction is now commonplace. We converse with the digital assistants on our phones and our connected home devices, and the experience is improving all the time. But how do we design experiences for voice interaction? What can we learn from the experiences of using first generation voice input/output technologies like screen readers and speech recognition tools? Full of practical ideas and interesting possibilities, this talk explores the past, present, and future of voice interaction design; and considers how to use the Inclusive Design Principles to create voice experiences that really work.

Alex’s talk, *The New Mobile Reality*, looks at how computing is inexorably moving to mobile, but mobile isn’t a static target. If the web is going to be the future of client-side computing, it has to deliver outstanding experiences across the full set of devices and network users come to our services with. This talk digs into the constraints and how respecting them — and leaning on the platform — can help unlock our creativity for the greatest number of users.
